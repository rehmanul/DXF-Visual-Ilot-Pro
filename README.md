# DXF Visual Ilot Pro

A professional CAD visualization and îlot placement application for floor plan optimization.

## Features

### 1. Loading the Plan
- Walls (black lines)
- Restricted areas (light blue - stairs, elevators)
- Entrances/Exits (red areas)
- No îlot placement touching red areas

### 2. Îlot Placement Rules
- User-defined layout profiles (10%, 25%, 30%, 35%)
- Automatic placement in available zones
- Avoid red and blue areas
- Allow îlots to touch black walls (except near entrances)

### 3. Corridors Between Îlots
- Mandatory corridors between facing îlot rows ✓
- Must touch both îlot rows ✓
- Must not overlap any îlot ✓
- Configurable corridor width (default: 1.2m) ✓
- Automatic L-shaped corridors for non-overlapping rows ✓
- Perpendicular access corridors for row ends ✓

### 4. Output
- Îlots neatly arranged
- All constraints respected
- Corridors automatically added
- No overlaps between îlots

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **CAD Processor**
   - Handles DXF, DWG, and PDF file parsing
   - Extracts geometric data for walls, restricted areas, and entrances

2. **Îlot Placement Service**
   - Analyzes available space
   - Places îlots according to size requirements
   - Respects all placement constraints

3. **Corridor Generator**
   - Automatically creates corridors between facing rows of îlots
   - Ensures corridors touch both îlot rows
   - Prevents overlaps with îlots or restricted areas
   - Supports configurable corridor width

4. **Corridor Optimizer**
   - Optimizes corridor networks for maximum efficiency
   - Removes redundant corridors
   - Merges adjacent corridors
   - Straightens corridor paths

5. **Visualization System**
   - Base view: Shows only walls, entrances, and restricted areas
   - Detailed view: Shows îlots and corridors
   - Interactive controls for zooming, panning, and toggling elements
   - Professional color coding and measurements

## Usage

1. Upload a CAD file (DXF, DWG, or PDF)
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Generate îlots with the desired density
4. Adjust corridor width if needed
5. Export the final layout

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Windows

```
# Run the start script
start-app.bat
```

#### Other Platforms

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Testing the Corridor Generation

#### Full System Test (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
test-full-system.bat

# Other platforms
node test-full-corridor-system.js
```

This comprehensive test validates:
- Îlot placement with proper spacing
- Corridor generation between facing rows
- 1.2m default corridor width
- No overlaps between îlots and corridors
- Full connectivity of all îlots
- Realistic space utilization

The system is now production-ready with full professional implementation.

## Technical Details

### Corridor Generation Algorithm

The enhanced corridor generation algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Group Îlots by Spatial Proximity**
   - Identify clusters of îlots using adaptive distance calculation
   - Consider îlot distribution and average sizes

2. **Organize Îlots into Facing Rows**
   - Group îlots by Y coordinates with dynamic tolerance
   - Sort each row by X coordinate
   - Filter rows to ensure meaningful groupings

3. **Create Mandatory Corridors Between Facing Rows**
   - Identify rows that are facing each other (30% minimum overlap)
   - Create horizontal corridors in overlapping X ranges
   - Generate L-shaped corridors for non-overlapping rows
   - Ensure all corridors touch both îlot rows

4. **Generate Perpendicular Access Corridors**
   - Create vertical access corridors at row ends
   - Ensure proper circulation and accessibility

5. **Connect Isolated Îlots**
   - Find îlots not connected to the main network
   - Create optimal connections based on layout analysis
   - Prefer horizontal or vertical connections based on context

6. **Validate and Optimize**
   - Ensure no overlaps with îlots or restricted zones
   - Remove redundant corridors using minimum spanning tree
   - Merge adjacent corridors where possible
   - Straighten corridor paths for efficiency

### Visualization Modes

- **Base Mode**: Shows only the floor plan (walls, entrances, restricted areas)
- **Detailed Mode**: Shows the complete layout with îlots and corridors
